The Role



Castor‚Äôs products have supported over 100.000 medical researchers to capture almost 250 million data points in over 8.000 research projects across the globe - and as we scale, these numbers are rapidly increasing. This continuous growth requires a sustainable yet flexible infrastructure that supports the global roll-out of our platform while meeting the needs of our customers with respect to reliability and security. We are now looking to expand our team with additional infrastructure specialists and DevOps enthusiasts to make sure we can continue to meet these requirements over the coming years.



As a Platform Engineer, you will be joining the team which supports Castor‚Äôs developers in getting their services running in production in a secure and reliable manner. After successfully completing a journey into public cloud throughout 2021-2022, our team is now helping development teams leverage cloud technologies and SaaS options in their products. As such, the main focus of this role is to build out a platform and fundamental infrastructure necessary for product development teams to operate their services on top of Azure cloud solutions.


Typical day to day work will also include maintenance work necessary to ‚Äúkeep the lights on‚Äù. We strive to find a balance between minimizing toil and being pragmatic, which means not everything is perfectly automated, but we‚Äôre certainly biased towards avoiding manual and repetitive work.
You will be responsible for:


Assisting in the design and implementation of solutions for Castor‚Äôs product development teams to run their services on Azure cloud.
Following established best practices at Castor for utilizing cloud solutions, and sharing this expertise with product development teams through the creation of guidelines, documentation, and active participation in training sessions.
Improving the security and reliability of platform-owned services by following established internal and external requirements.
Participating in 24x7 on-call rotations for core platform services.
Contributing to technical documentation efforts and Architecture Decision Records to ensure clear understanding of architecture and services.
Providing operational support for platform-owned services through the support rotation.




The Team



You can expect to join a team which follows a set of core values, guiding daily collaboration. These include a commitment to deliver high-quality work, good documentation and knowledge sharing, and a strong focus on transparency and openness. While we don‚Äôt automate everything, we try to minimize toil in the day-to-day and ensure a good work-life balance by being flexible around working hours.
The Platform team is, just like the rest of Castor, working remote-first. This means we strive to enable asynchronous work as much as possible. Current members are based in the Netherlands and Sweden, but we also welcome applications from further afield.




About You 



We are looking to hire a platform engineer into our team. Ideally, you will have at least 3 years of experience with DevOps or Site Reliability Engineering, but we‚Äôre open to a broad range of skills and expertise. We‚Äôll definitely consider people who‚Äôve been in application development roles as well, especially when you‚Äôve touched a lot of deployment pipelines or monitoring/observability problems.


To give you an idea of skills we‚Äôre looking for, consider the following as guidelines:


An understanding of the basics of various system/cloud architectures and their pros and cons.
Foundational skills in deploying and optimizing cloud-based solutions on a major cloud provider, such as Azure or AWS.
General knowledge of Linux, web applications, networking, and databases.
Exposure to containerization and surrounding tooling, such as Docker.
Understanding what Infrastructure as Code entails, including tools like Terraform, and recognizing its advantages.
Familiarity with monitoring server and application performance, coupled with the ability to troubleshoot issues.
Openness to mentoring and support for personal development.


Please note that we are open to hire from different European countries. However, we are unable to accept applications from France, Spain, Bulgaria, Sweden, and Switzerland.
